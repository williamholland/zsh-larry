Larry is your zsh terminal companion!

# INSTALL

To install Larry add the following to your `~/.zshrc`

    source /path/to/larry.zsh
    # optional
    alias poke="grumpy_larry"
    alias tickle="happy_larry"

Then to see Larry use the `$LARRY` variable in your `PROMPT` or `RPROMPT`,
ensure that these are defined _after_ `larry.zsh` is sourced
